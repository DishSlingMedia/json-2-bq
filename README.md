# json-2-bq

This is meant to be a utility that takes a new-line json file, and generate the bigquery schemas as well as the json file/function needed to use the gcs text to bq template (https://cloud.google.com/dataflow/docs/templates/provided-templates#cloud-storage-text-to-bigquery).

### Open issues:
* Data types (does this identify anything other than object and string/text)?

### Imports/Dependencies:
* Genson
